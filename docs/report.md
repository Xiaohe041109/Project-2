## Goal of the project:
Hurricane Guard in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) as a project for our CMPSC 132-002: Programming and Computation II: Data Structures course, taught by Professor Janghoon Yang. This project aims to develop a disaster relief resource management system to assist in hurricane relief efforts by performing the following functions:
  - Users can view a real-time updated forecast based on their geographic location.
  - Users find the nearest supply and shelter based on their geographic location.
  - Resource providers (e.g., shelters or supply depots) can manage inventories of essential items for hurricane relief.
  - Users can view disaster relief resources and efficiently prepare

## Significance of the project:
Hurricanes can cause widespread damage, disrupt supply chains, and place a huge burden on relief efforts. The project is innovative in its ability to address these challenges by:
Providing a simple and scalable solution to manage disaster resources effectively.
  - Utilizing programming principles such as object-oriented design to achieve maintainability and extensibility.
  - Provide users with real-time updates using APIs for weather updates or resource tracking.
  - The system is significant because it combines technical knowledge with real-world applications to aid in disaster preparedness and response, potentially saving lives and resources.
