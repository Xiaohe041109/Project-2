Goal of the project:
  The goal of this project is to develop a disaster relief resource management system to assist in hurricane relief efforts. The system can perform the following functions:
    Users find the nearest supply and shelter based on their geographic location.
    Resource providers (e.g., shelters or supply depots) manage inventories of essential items.
    Efficiently allocate disaster relief resources by centralizing data and making quick decisions.

Significance of the project:
  Hurricanes can cause widespread damage, disrupt supply chains, and place a huge burden on relief efforts. The project is innovative in its ability to address these challenges by:
    Providing a modular, scalable solution to effectively manage disaster resources.
    Providing users with real-time updates and distance-based prioritization.
    Utilizing programming principles such as object-oriented design to achieve maintainability and extensibility.
    Provide flexible extensions to use real-time APIs for weather updates or resource tracking.
    The system is significant because it combines technical knowledge with real-world applications to aid in disaster preparedness and response, potentially saving lives and resources.

Installation and Instruction to use:
  Installation:
    1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
    2. Install required libraries:
      pip install json
    3. Clone or download the project files to your local system.
  Usage:
    1. Run the program:
      python disaster_relief_system.py
    2. The main script will:
      Show the nearest supplies and shelters for a user near Penn State Abington.
      Allow inventory updates and new resource additions.
      Save and load resource data from a file.

Systematic Structure:
  The program is implemented using an object-oriented approach within a single class, DisasterReliefSystem.
    Class: DisasterReliefSystem
      Attributes:
        resources_data: Stores the inventory of supplies and shelters.
      Methods:
        __init__: Initializes the system with data.
        calculate_distance: Computes geographic distance.
        find_nearest_resources: Finds and sorts nearest resources.
        update_inventory: Updates stock levels for supplies.
        add_new_resource: Adds new resources.
        save_data_to_file: Saves data to a JSON file.
        load_data_from_file: Loads data from a JSON file.
