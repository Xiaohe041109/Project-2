Goal of the project:
The goal of this project is to develop a disaster relief resource management system to assist in hurricane relief efforts. The system can perform the following functions:
Users find the nearest supply and shelter based on their geographic location.
Resource providers (e.g., shelters or supply depots) manage inventories of essential items.
Efficiently allocate disaster relief resources by centralizing data and making quick decisions.
